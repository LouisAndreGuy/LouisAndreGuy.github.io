I recently migrated to Austin and got hired as a Customer Support Representative and am looking forward to that. I plan on saving some money to fund my projects and Hopefully it'll leave some money to save and buy myself a new computer or maybe just go on a road trip.

I'm starting a blog to document my projects and interests. I have not programmed nearly enough recently so this is my way of getting back into it. Most of my posts are going to be about challenges I encounter, new tools and frameworks I learn (like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)), and other neat stuff.

Don't be surprised if you see anything from me going out to look for minerals and fossils, or some pictures of a road trip.
